# Deepvest: Investing in People's Potential

## The Concept

Instead of investing in companies, what if you could invest directly in talented individuals, betting on their future success and earnings? Deepvest introduces a novel way to do just that.

## How It Works

### For the Earner (Talented Individual)

1. **Commitment:** Individuals (earners) pledge a percentage of their current salary as collateral. This collateral is pooled together with other earners to create a fund.
2. **Tokenization:** Based on the amount each earner contributes to the pool, tokens are issued. These tokens represent a share of the pooled collateral and potential future earnings.
3. **Earnings and Dividends:** If an earner's salary increases the following year, they commit to returning 50% of the increased amount to the dividend pool. This pool is then distributed to token holders.
4. **Collateral Security:** The collateral acts as security for investors. If an earner's salary doesn't increase or if they lose their job, the collateral can be used to compensate investors.

### For the Buyer (Investor)

1. **Purchase:** Investors buy tokens from the pooled fund. The price of each token is based on the total value of the pooled collateral, plus a markup for potential future earnings.
2. **Returns:** If earners experience a salary increase, investors receive dividends from the 50% of the increased amount pledged by earners. 
3. **Security:** The collateral provides a safety net. If an earner doesn't achieve a salary increase or loses their job, the investor can recoup some of their investment from the collateral.

## An Example:

Let's say 10 earners come together and contribute a total of $390K as collateral based on percentages of their current salaries. This collateral is then tokenized into 1 million tokens. 

If an earner with a current salary of $250K contributes 10% (or $25K) to the pool, they would receive tokens proportional to their contribution. If all tokens are sold to investors at a markup, the proceeds (minus fees) are distributed back to the earners based on their token holdings. 

The following year, if the earner's salary increases, they would return 50% of the increment to the dividend pool, which would then be distributed to all token holders.

## Benefits:

- **For Earners:** They receive an upfront investment which they can use as they see fit. It's a way to monetize future potential today.
- **For Investors:** They have the opportunity for returns based on the future success of talented individuals. The collateral provides a level of security for their investment.

## More Details

### Earner's Incentive and Profit

Suppose an earner has a base salary of **$250K** annually. They commit **10%** of their future earnings to investors in exchange for an upfront investment in their potential. Initially, 10% of their $250K salary, which is **$25K**, is pooled with contributions from other earners. If 10 such earners contribute varying percentages of their salaries, the total pool might amount to **$390K**. This pool is then tokenized into **1M** tokens, with each earner receiving tokens proportional to their contribution.

|Potential Earner| Present Salary| Percentage Committed in Collateral| Collateral Amount in $| Relative % of Crowd Fund|Shares Tokenized|
|----------------|---------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|----------------|
|Earner 1	 |$250,000 	|10%	 |$25,000 	|6.42%	 |64,210| 
|Earner 2	 |$350,000 	|13%	 |$45,500 	|11.69%	 |116,862| 
|Earner 3	 |$200,000 	|9%	 	 |$18,000 	|4.62%	 |46,231| 
|Earner 4	 |$190,000 	|8%	 	 |$15,200 	|3.90%	 |39,040| 
|Earner 5	 |$400,000 	|30%	 |$120,000 	|30.82%	 |308,208| 
|Earner 6	 |$195,000 	|18%	 |$35,100 	|9.02%	 |90,151| 
|Earner 7	 |$296,000 	|20%	 |$59,200 	|15.20%	 |152,049| 
|Earner 8	 |$310,000 	|17%	 |$52,700 	|13.54%	 |135,355| 
|Earner 9	 |$232,900 	|5%	 	 |$11,645 	|2.99%	 |29,909| 
|Earner 10	 |$233,400 	|3%	 	 |$7,002 	|1.80%	 |17,984| 
|Crowd Token |$2,657,300 	     |15%	    |$389,347|1,000,000|

The base price for each token is calculated to be **$0.39**. With a **+30%** premium markup and a **+5%** service fee, the final token price becomes **$0.53**. 

Selling all 1M tokens would generate **$526K**. After deducting the **$26K** in fees, the remaining **$500K** is distributed among the earners based on their respective contributions. 

The pooled collateral acts as security and is reserved for the following year. It serves as a fallback in two scenarios:
1) If the earner becomes unemployed.
2) If their salary doesn't increase from the current year.

### Buyer's Incentive and Profit

The next step is to forecast the earners' potential salary for the following year.

|Potential Earner|Salary Raise|Future Salary|Dividend (50% of Commit)|Dividend Pool|Net Revenue to Potential Earners
|--------||--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|Earner 1|3%| $257,500 |5%| $12,875 | $19,187.50|
|Earner 2|5%| $367,500 |7%| $23,888 | $34,466.25|
|Earner 3|6%| $212,000 |5%| $9,540 | $13,545.00|
|Earner 4|1%| $191,900 |4%| $7,676 | $11,818.00|
|Earner 5|0%| $400,000 |15%| $60,000 | $93,900.00| 
|Earner 6|0%| $195,000 |9%| $17,550 | $27,465.75|
|Earner 7|1%| $298,960 |10%| $29,896 | $46,028.00| 
|Earner 8|10%| $341,000 |9%| $28,985 | $38,602.75|
|Earner 9|20%| $279,480 |3%| $6,987 | $7,947.71| 
|Earner 10|0%| $233,400 |2%| $3,501 | $5,479.07|
|Crowd Token|||| $200,898 | $298,440.03|

Earners return **50%** of any salary increase to the dividend pool, which is then shared among the token holders. In the given example, considering some earners receive a raise while others don't, the dividend pool totals **$298K**. Combined with the previously sold capital, the total comes to **$726K**, giving each token a new value of **$0.73**. This translates to a profit of **$0.2** per token, or a 38% ROI.

For illustrative purposes, here's how the profit might be distributed among five example investors:

|Owner of Shares|Shares Owned|Cost|Future Value|Profit to Buyer|
|---------------|------------|----|------------|---------------|
|Buyer 1| 300,000 | $157,685.54 | $217,954.79 | $60,269.25|
|Buyer 2| 200,000 | $105,123.69 | $145,303.19 | $40,179.50|
|Buyer 3| 100,000 | $52,561.85 | $72,651.60 | $20,089.75|
|Buyer 4| 350,000 | $183,966.46 | $254,280.58 | $70,314.13| 
|Buyer 5| 50,000 | $26,280.92 | $36,325.80 | $10,044.88|

The collateral is utilized to compensate for situations where an earner experiences no salary increase or loses their job.
